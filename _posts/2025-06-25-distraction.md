I just spent the first half of the morning faffing about with SVG files and the second half working through **Intermediate CSS Concepts**.

I told myself I wasn't going to get sucked in by the SVG work - quick and easy; no need to muck about. And, I did start that way. But, the Ruby logo was all gradients and misaligned points; next thing I knew I was knee deep in redesigning it.

Conversely, **Intermediate CSS concepts** is not especially stimulating. So far, mostly reading and, with a few interesting edge case exceptions, mostly things I know. Nearly halfway done, but have now bounced off it. Blogging now is a compromise with myself, rather than just stopping entirely.

I think one of the problems was leaving a task of lesser importance as my first task for today. I went to update my Odin Project repo links yesterday and, trying to add the new section for the **Full Stack JS Path**, ended up making a complete mess. It was meant to be a *"quick, five minute job"*; instead, over an hour later (I think), I was calling it a day to go and make myself some food.

I only have two thoughts that seem remotely useful.

1. Practically speaking I can try to finish each day with a clear idea of tomorrow's next task. Like today, actually. Rather, than finishing the lesson I was on I have stopped just before the next assignment. Tomorrow, I know I am doing that assignment and what the assignment calls for - I can just jump straight in.
2. Somewhat more amorphously, I can try to accept that I did around five hours work in total, infinitely better than zero hours; and, while I may not have spent the time quite as I envisioned, the task of refactoring my contents did need to be done. Further, if I didn't have problems like bouncing off activities I find under-stimulating, I wouldn't be titrating ADHD medication in the first place. Plus, its only fair to view these things in the wider context of my life - the struggle extends beyond this sphere and trying to get myself back to where I was before the previous medication took its toll is not without mental and physical toll.

I don't know if that is actually helpful. It feels like a cop-out. Like I should just suck-it-up and keep on keeping on. Even though I know that doesn't work in the long run and that run is often all too short.
