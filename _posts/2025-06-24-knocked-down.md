I have been struggling to keep my work for The Odin Project on track. I am currently titrating new ADHD medication and results have been mixed with a recent, protracted trend towards impeded focus, reduced concentration and a tendency to obsess over non-essential elements that do not deliver core functionality.

I've had been stuck on the most recent project to build a calculator for a week or more.  The largest problem has been repeatedly iterating on the graphical design elements rather than coding the underlying logic using JavaScript. Secondarily, when I did attempt to code logic, it became clear my planning was not adequate.

To combat the later issue, I amended my initial design document to include a flow diagram of the main logic process. This is certainly easier to parse than the previously employed paradigm; and, I believe, better encapsulates the required logic (at least in part, due to the increased readability). As already stated in the project readme:

> as much as I chafe against [the design phase], even my somewhat mediocre planning was of huge benefit after my second revision.

The former, and more pressing, issue is also more resistant to improvement; stemming, as it does, from exogenous medications. However, this blog is my initial approach. Following the reasoning that it may focus my endeavours and keep me more accountable while tracking the various strategies employed and the efficacy of each. There is some worry it will become another non-essential element that monopolises my attention. However, lacking alternate ideas, I shall be mindful of this pitfall; and, in an attempt to keep things on track, follow the guidance of [another](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-experience-writing-dev-logs-wise-zhongshi-xi) on how to write dev logs *properly*:

> 1. Keep the story true and be honest with yourself.
> 2. Be retrospective - write what you did well, what you did bad and think about actions you want to take next time.
> 3. Use **STAR** - Situation, Task, Approach, Result - to mange posts in an explicit and logical way.

While I drafted the majority of this post two days ago, it is still to early to adequately gauge results. Especially, as the titration process recently changed the medication I am taking - acting as a confounding variable. That said, I did finish the project yesterday (prioritising that over initialising this blog).
