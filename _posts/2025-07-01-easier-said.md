I have been struggling again/still. Took a long weekend - Friday through Monday, hoping that might help.

It does not appear to have worked.

Had little to no interest in returning to the project, and continuing with forms, this morning. I decided to "do at least half an hour". A small commitment to build momentum. I did manage the thirty minutes but that is all.

Conventional wisdom might suggest I need a 'proper' break/rest. First, I am lacking in alternative actives I find truly restful or fulfilling. And, second, prior experience suggests there is a high probability I will end up leaving things for so long I don't feel comfortable picking up where I was.

Suggestions:
- Think of a thing to do instead
- Do it only for the prescribed period of time

easier said than done...
