Recently (late 2024) diagnosed as neurodivergent after two decades of misdiagnosis. Trying to do something productive with my time and take my adventures in software development a little more seriously.

Struggling with the effects of medication during the titration phase and blogging to see if it will help keep me a little more focused.

Pretty bad at writing about myself.
